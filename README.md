## ForensicArtifacts.com Artifact Repository

A free, community-sourced, machine-readable knowledge base of forensic artifacts
that the world can use both as an information source and within other tools.

The [ForensicArtifacts.com](http://forensicartifacts.com/) artifact repository
was forked from the [GRR project](https://github.com/google/grr) artifact
collection into a stand-alone repository that is not tool-specific. The GRR
developers will migrate to using this repository and make contributions here. In
addition the ForensicArtifact team will begin backfilling artifacts in the new 
format from the [ForensicArtifacts.com](http://forensicartifacts.com/) website.

We're still in the process of setting this up for community contributions, but
the existing artifacts are usable right now. Bear with us while we add
documentation and code for artifact validation.

For some background on the artifacts system and how we expect it to be used see 
[this blackhat presentation](https://www.blackhat.com/us-14/archives.html#grr-find-all-the-badness-collect-all-the-things)
and [youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DudGrSv26NY) from the GRR
team.
